# MyPersonalBlog-React
(This project is still in development)

Welcome to MyPersonalBlog using React repository. I am a web developer who loves to create interactive and dynamic web applications using React. 
React is a powerful JavaScript library that allows me to build user interfaces with reusable components and state management. In this website, you can find my personal blog where I share my skills and accademic experiences, as well as some of the projects I built using React. These projects include tic-tac-toe game, a shopping cart and more. You can view the source code and live demo of each project by clicking on the links below soon. I hope you enjoy browsing through my website and feel free to contact me if you have any questions or feedback.


1. The <h4>tic-tac-toe</h4> game built in this application uses concepts like useState hooks, JSX, Lifting State Up, other Custom Hooks.

2. The <h4>Add-to-cart</h4> application is noted as Shop in this application. This application allows users to add items to a cart and view the total cost of the items in the cart. The application uses React to render the user interface and to keep track of the items in the cart. The application also uses a database to store the items in the cart.

The application is designed to be easy to use and to provide a convenient way for users to add items to a cart and to view the total cost of the items in the cart and the application is built using all the concepts used in tic-tac-toe app and some of the other concepts like useRef, useReducer, useContext Hooks and React-Modal etc..
