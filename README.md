# MyPersonalBlog-React
Welcome to MyPersonalBlog using React repository. I am a web developer who loves to create interactive and dynamic web applications using React. 
React is a powerful JavaScript library that allows me to build user interfaces with reusable components and state management. In this website, you can find my personal blog where I share my skills and accademic experiences, as well as some of the projects I built using React. These projects include tic-tac-toe game, a shopping cart and more. You can view the source code and live demo of each project by clicking on the links below. I hope you enjoy browsing through my website and feel free to contact me if you have any questions or feedback.
